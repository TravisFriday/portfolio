          Hello everybody, welcome to my blog. This series will tell stories all
          about me. Whether it's about my career as a software engineer, my
          hobbies, and things that has happened to me, good and bad. I will be
          genuine, not highlighting my successes but also my failures, and how I
          overcome those failures.
