        <p>
          I am a passionate Software Engineer with a Bachelor of Applied Science
          in Computer Engineering. My Expertise is in Front End Development,
          Data Analysis, Product Management. I have a keen interest in mixed
          reality technology, biomedical engineering technology, and green
          technology.
          <br />
          <br />
          My ambition is to leverage technology in order to directly impact
          communities who have been forgotten. This is why I am currently
          developing a web application in React.js to empower black-owned
          businesses and consumers to buy/sell products in a marketplace. This
          eCommerce platform will encourage black communities all over the globe
          to support each other and grow. This is my first step in making the
          world a better place.
